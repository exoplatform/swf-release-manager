:toc:

This is the *user guide* to be able to release one or several eXo projects.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prerequisites

Check with the *Engineering team* the projects and versions to Release.

== Overview

image::exo-release-manager-overview.png[]

== Release Process

There are 3 big parts for the eXo Release Process:

. first, *create the required resources* (JIRA, JSON catalog) for the Release and *synchronize* GitHub repositories
. then *execute* the eXo Release from Jenkins
. finally, clean up used resources

=== Prepare the Release

==== Create the JIRA SWF

All the Release Process is based on a JIRA ID, so a JIRA Release must be created with the following params:

JIRA Project:: *Company Software Factory (SWF)* : *https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SWF*
JIRA Summary:: *[Release]*...
+
[IMPORTANT]
It's *mandatory* to start the Summary with the prefix *[Release]* (for Jenkins Job ) +
_example: [Release] Weekly Releases W27_
+
JIRA Components:: Support
JIRA Description:: Add all projects to release with *Git branches and versions*
+

[source,jira]
----
GateIn Portal
/----
** Release version: *{{4.4.0-M06-PLF}}*
** Release branch: https://github.com/exoplatform/gatein-portal/tree/develop

PLF
/----
* PLF projects from {{platform-ui}} to {{platform}} version
** Release version: *{{4.4.0-M06}}*
** Release branch: https://github.com/exoplatform/commons/tree/develop

Chat Application
/----
* Release version: *{{1.4.0-M04}}*
* Release branch: https://github.com/exoplatform/chat-application/tree/develop
----
+

[TIP]
Use an existing one https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SWF-3688 and clone it.


==== Create the JSON Catalog

Based on the *JIRA description about project to release* and the eXo Components diagram, create the JSON Catalog
for the release:

[source,json]
.JSON Catalog example
----
...

{
     "name":"wiki",  <1>
     "git_organization":"exoplatform",    <2>
     "labels":"plf",   <3>
     "maven_property_version":"org.exoplatform.wiki.version",   <4>
     "container": {
       "image": "exoplatform/release:jdk8-maven32",    <5>
       "step": 6        <6>
     },
     "release":{
        "branch":"develop",     <7>
        "version":"4.4.0-M06",    <8>
        "current_snapshot_version":"4.4.x-SNAPSHOT",    <9>
        "next_snapshot_version":"4.4.x-SNAPSHOT",     <10>
        "patches":"",     <11>
        "patches_after_release":"",    <12>
        "nexus_host":"exoplatform",     <13>
        "nexus_staging_profile":"public"   <14>
     }
  },
  {
     "name":"social",
     "git_organization":"exoplatform",
     "labels":"plf",
     "maven_property_version":"org.exoplatform.social.version",
     "container": {
       "image": "exoplatform/release:jdk8-maven32",
       "step": 5
     },
     "release":{
        "branch":"develop",
        "version":"4.4.0-M06",
        "current_snapshot_version":"4.4.x-SNAPSHOT",
        "next_snapshot_version":"4.4.x-SNAPSHOT",
        "patches":"",
        "patches_after_release":"",
        "nexus_host":"exoplatform",
        "nexus_staging_profile":"public"
     }
  },
...
----
<1> *GitHub* project name
<2> *GitHub* organization to used
<3> *NOT USED for now* (will be use to build projects by category instead of given all projects names to the process)
<4> *Maven property* to find in Maven POMs of *others projects* which depends on this project (in order to replace the SNAPSHOT version by the RELEASE one)
<5> *eXo Docker Image* to use to build and release the project (be careful of the Maven and JDK stack)
<6> *NOT USED for now* (will be use to build projects in parallel if no maven dependencies between projects)
<7> *Git branch* to use for the basecode to build
<8> *Version to Release* for this project
<9> *Current version* of the project to replace in the POMs project *AND in projects which depends on it*
<10> *Next version* to set *in projects which depends on it*
<11> *NOT USED for now* (used by old release scripts, remove it?)
<12> *NOT USED for now* (used by old release scripts, remove it?)
<13> *Nexus Host* to use for the project
<14> *Nexus Staging Profile* to use for the project

[IMPORTANT]
The *Nexus Staging Profile*  is very important specially for Private and Private Trial projects.


==== Execute Jenkins jobs for Synchronization

As eXo Releases are only executed on *eXoPlatform* GitHub organization, we need to synchronize codebase between others organization and this one:

. Execute the following jobs to synchronize all GitHub repositories:
.. Sync *exodev* with *exoplatform* projects
... https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/infra-synchronize-dev-blessed-develop/
.. Sync *exo-addons* with *exoplatform* projects
... https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/infra-synchronize-addons-repositories/
. *deactivate* those Jenkins jobs during the *Release Process*

=== Execute the Release

==== Start the Release

* Go to the *eXo Release Multiple Projects* Jenkins job:
** https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/exo-release-multiple-projects/
* Build it with the following parameters:
** *TASK_ID*: Put the TASK_ID that you have created for the release
** *CATALOG_BASE_URL*: Keep the default URL or update it if you use anoter location for JSON catalog
** *PROJECTS*: fill all the projects you want to release (projects have to be declared in JSON Catalog)
+
[IMPORTANT]
be careful to the order of the projects, they will be released in the order you add it.
+
** *RELEASE_CMD*: Choose the *start* command
** *RELEASE_PROJECTS_IN_PARALLEL*: keep this box unchecked
** *JENKINS_NODE_USER*: keep the default user
** *BUILD_USER_ID*: set your username

==== Validate the Release

When the Release *start* step is OK (it means that all projects have been tested from the Staging Repositories),
you can validate the release by release all Nexus repositories:

* Go to the *eXo Release Multiple Projects* Jenkins job:
** https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/exo-release-multiple-projects/
* Build it with the following parameters:
** *TASK_ID*: Put the TASK_ID that you have created for the release
** *CATALOG_BASE_URL*: Keep the default URL or update it if you use anoter location for JSON catalog
** *PROJECTS*: fill all the projects you want to validate the release (projects have to be declared in JSON Catalog)
** *RELEASE_CMD*: Choose the *validate* command
** *RELEASE_PROJECTS_IN_PARALLEL*: keep this box unchecked
** *JENKINS_NODE_USER*: keep the default user
** *BUILD_USER_ID*: set your username

=== Notify and Clean up resources

* If PLF has been released then *notify the CWI team* about that, so that they can use it
** write a message on the eXo Tribe Chat Room *ITOP & CWI / PRD*
* Clean all Docker containers and volumes with Jenkins Job:
** https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/exo-release-clean-resources/
* *Re-activate* Jenkins jobs for synchronization:
** https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/infra-synchronize-dev-blessed-develop/
** https://ci.exoplatform.org/job/infra-synchronize-addons-repositories/


== Known issues

=== Nexus Repository: Rule "RepositoryWritePolicy" failures

The Nexus Repository failed to release because of *properties file*

[source, text]
----
[ERROR]
[ERROR] Nexus Staging Rules Failure Report
[ERROR] ==================================
[ERROR]
[ERROR] Repository "exo_public_releases-2146" failures
[ERROR]   Rule "RepositoryWritePolicy" failures
[ERROR]     * Artifact updating: Repository ='exo-releases:[H][R] eXo Releases' does not allow updating artifact='/129ae1bfa78515.properties'
----
====
This problem is due to the fact that you have launch the release twice (until step nexus:close) without cleaning the workspace before the 2nd execution.
So you have a XXXX.properties files which contains references to a unknown (removed)  Nexus Staging repository. +

*SOLUTION*

. Remove the Nexus Staging repository
. Remove the Release Workspace Docker volume
. Re-execute the release
====


== FAQ

=== How to see release logs for each project?

Connect to the server *release.exoplatform.org* and inspect the related Docker volume, all the data are in those volumes.

=== How to quickly reuse a failed Jenkins Job?

Use the *Rebuild* Jenkins option to have the form pre-filled and update the projects to release if needeed. 

=== How to run/test the eXo Release Manager locally?

. On `swf-release-manager` project
.. Update Application scripts
.. Build an archive for eXo Release Manager with bugs fixed
... `tar -cvzf exo-release-manager.tar.gz .`
. On `exo-release` project:
.. Update Dockerfile to ADD `exo-release-manager.tar.gz` into the Docker Image
+
[source,shell]
----
...
ADD exo-release-manager.tar.gz ${EXO_CI_TMP_DIR}
RUN cp -R ${EXO_CI_TMP_DIR}/app/conf/* ${CONFIG_DIR} \

        && cp -R ${EXO_CI_TMP_DIR}/app/datas/* ${DATAS_DIR} \
        && chmod u+x ${SCRIPTS_DIR}/*.sh \
